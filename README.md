# kaggle_whale_identification

## Data Exploration
* Large imbalence of new whales /lots of whale types with just one sample
    * Leave in for now
* images of the flank can be small relative to entire image 
    -> train specifically these against same label?
    -> online community uses bounding boxes for image processing. How easy is it to automate this?
    * Don't care for now

* images can be of different sizes
    * Resize for now
##TODO
* learn data augmentation library -> look at the example on Kaggle
* get more samples from server

nearest neighbors at the end
## Plan
